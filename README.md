# Tea Timer

If you are anything like me, making cups of tea only to forget about them while they are stewing; then you need this app!

## Usage

1. Pin this app to your task bar
2. Run it just before you make a cup of tea
3. Be alerted when your cup of tea is ready

## Command line arguments

You can specify a time in minutes as the only command line argument. This will change the timer from the default 2 minutes to an interval of your choice.

## Download

## Notes

 * When running this program for the first time, make sure you run it as Administrator, especially if this is the first time you have run a Visual Basic 4 program on your computer.
